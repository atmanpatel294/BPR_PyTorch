# Item recommendation using Collaborative Filtering

Extended the basic implementation of [Bayesian Personalised Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2618.pdf)  and [Social BPR](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/cikm14.pdf) to include the influence of communities. The code has been implemented in PyTorch.
